<!-- write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.) -->
1. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.
2. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
